# Communication Network

The whole internet is divided into different communication subnets based on a logical division of the IP network.

In order to exchange of information between computers, communication protocol is defined as a set of rules that must be followed on how to exchange information for communicating with each other. Some protocols include: [UDP](cybersecurity/udp.md), [TCP](cybersecurity/tcp.md) and [DHCP](cybersecurity/dhcp.md).

To understand and implement standard protocols in network communications, [OSI and TCP/IP](cybersecurity/osi-tcp-ip-model.md) conceptual frameworks (models) are introduced.
