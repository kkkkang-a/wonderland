# Communication Network

The whole internet is divided into different communication subnets based on a logical division of the IP network.

In order to exchange of information between computers, communication protocol is defined as a set of rules that must be followed on how to exchange information for communicating with each other. Some protocols include: [UDP](udp.md), [TCP](tcp.md) and [DHCP](dhcp.md).

To understand and implement standard protocols in network communications, [OSI and TCPIP](osi-tcp-ip-model.md) conceptual frameworks (models) are introduced.
