`hello world!`

This is a digital garden for [me](https://github.com/kkkkang-a), a university student, to collect all my notes and thoughts when learning computer science and data science.

Here, the main focus will be the following fields:

- [🧠 Artificial Intelligence](artificial-intelligence.md)
- [🧑‍💻 Computer Science](computer-science.md)
- [🌐 Cyber Security](cybersecuirty.md)
- [💾 Database System](database-system.md)
- [📊 Data Science](data-science.md)
- [💻 Software Development](software-development.md)

This garden is written with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and published using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). It is stored in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kkkkang-a/wonderland), with all assets for building this website. It is open-source and welcome to any suggestions and contributions.

If the garden somehow helps you in your way of learning, a star ⭐️ is appreciated :)
