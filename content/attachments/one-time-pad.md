# One-Time Pad Symmetric Encryption

In cryptography, a one-time pad is a system where a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message, which is then decrypted by the receiver using a matching one-time pad and key.

One-time pads are typically used in situations where security is of utmost importance, and the overhead of managing unique keys is acceptable.

## Advantage

- **Unbreakable Encryption**: Each encryption is unique and bears no relation to the next encryption, making it practically impossible to detect patterns.
- **Perfect Secrecy**: When implemented correctly, a one-time pad provides perfect secrecy, meaning the encrypted message reveals no information about the original message without the key.

## Disadvantage

- **Key Length**: The key length has to be as long as the message, which can be impractical for large messages.
- **Key Reuse**: The key can be used only once, requiring the distribution and management of a large number of unique keys.
- **Key Distribution**: The challenge lies in securely distributing or exchanging the key between the sender and the receiver, as the key must be kept secret to maintain the security of the communication.
